Ruby/Sinatra Project with PostgreSQL and CRUD functionality

## Burger Tracker

Adam has an insatiable hunger for burgers. However, he only has a limited budget, so prefers to go to places that have a deal on. He would like a way to track which deals are available at which places on a given day so that he can maximise his burger intake for minimum spending.

## Project Spec:

* Add a burger eatery

* Add burgers available at an eatery and view them as a list

* Add a list of deals for an eatery with a label string e.g. "Two For One Tuesdays"

* A list of burgers that deal applies to

* The day that the deal is available on e.g. "Wednesday"

* Show the deals available by day of the week Mon - Sun

* Add a price to a burger and add a savings amount/percentage to a deal so it's clear how much Adam is saving

## Extension Ideas:

* Google Map feature
